# **CHESS** â™Ÿ

This project was created to practice in different aspects of game creation. The main topics I want to practice in are
GUI, AI and probably multiplayer programming.

I figured out that Chess would be a perfect game to start with, as it is wide-known and there are certainly a bunch of
guides and useful information on the web to fulfill my purpose. I understand the game rules, so it should ease the
process as I will be aware about result I want ro reach. And even if there are not much of rules in total, they are 
still diverse enough.

There is a plenty graphical assets for Chess on the web, but it should not be hard to create my 
own as well. 

AI programming is the most interesting part for now, as I plan to implement it in my next project, which will be much 
greater, so it would be nice to have an idea of AI logic and decision-making.

Multiplayer... it is not the priority, but why not. Chess may be played online, so I should to try implement such 
option.

Below is the list of features I would like to implement. This list will be updated with some new features is will find 
interesting enough. A checkmark around a feature indicates that the feature is successfully implemented.
