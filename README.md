# **CHESS** â™Ÿ

This project was created to practice different aspects of game creation. The main topics I want to practice are
GUI, AI, and probably multiplayer programming.

Chess would be a perfect game to start with, as it is well-known and there are certainly a bunch of
guides and useful information on the web to fulfill my purpose. I understand the game rules, so it should ease the
process as I will be aware of the result I want to reach. And even if there are not many rules, they are 
still diverse enough.

There are plenty of graphical assets for Chess on the web, but it should not be hard to create my 
own as well. 

AI programming is the most interesting part for now, as I plan to implement it in my next project, which will be much 
greater, so it would be nice to have an idea of AI logic and decision-making.

Multiplayer... is not the priority, but why not? Chess may be played online, so I should try to implement such 
option.

Below is the list of features I would like to implement. This list will be updated with some new features you will find 
interesting enough. A checkmark around a feature indicates that the feature is successfully implemented.
